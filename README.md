# class-manager
 An old Pascal project coded with Delphi that my math teacher asked me to develop when I was in middle school to manage his classes.
 
 It has a GUI that handles window resizing and interacts with `.csv` files storing class data.
 
 The GUI is looking a bit old but that was like 6 years ago.
 
 The executable file can be found in `Win32/Release/Points.exe`.
 
 This is For those who are interested in "digging up" this old language influenced by `Algol` and `Fortran`.
